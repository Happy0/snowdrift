# Hacking on Snowdrift

This contributor's guide provides some direction for how to best participate in
Snowdrift code development. We have a separate wiki page on the site discussing
[ways to help](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/how-to-help) beyond
coding.

## Build the site locally

The first step to working on the code: follow the [README](README.md) and
related links to get the code built on your local computer.

## Communicate with us

Please **ask for help** and/or let us know any confusion you have at any point
via any of the communication channels mentioned below or elsewhere. We're always
happy to help guide newcomers and help you get started making your first
contributions.

Ways to get in touch:

* Log-in with a user on the main Snowdrift.coop site and fill out a
  [volunteer form](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/volunteer)

* Sign up on the
  [dev email list](https://lists.snowdrift.coop/mailman/listinfo/dev)
  and perhaps
  [other email lists](https://lists.snowdrift.coop/)
  and send a message introducing yourself to the community.

* Visit `#snowdrift` on frenode.net
  [IRC](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/irc)
  and chat with other developers there.

## Next steps

With the code built, we suggest a few different options for moving forward:

* Look through the
  [newbie-friendly tickets](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/t?_hasdata=&f1=newbie-friendly)
  and see what looks interesting / doable.
  If you decide to work on a specific ticket, you can "claim" it once you have
  logged into the main site with a fully-established user.

* Play around with the site locally, and see if you can understand what does
  what. You may find bits that seem incomplete or confusing, and you can explore
  them and/or check with others about the status, such as whether the issue is
  known or tickets exist already.

* Explore the code itself by just opening files and see if you can figure out
  what does what and how things fit together. As you go, you may find places
  that could use fixes to match our
  [code style](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/coding#code-style-guide).

* Read further in the [BEGINNERS](BEGINNERS.md) and [GUIDE](GUIDE.md) files
  including the links. Learn more about the overall ecosystem and issues.
  Read our [coding wiki page](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/coding)
  and other pages throughout the Snowdrift.coop site.
