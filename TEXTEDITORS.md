# Text Editor Settings and Recommendations

This guide covers our recommended options for fully-FLO text-editors and IDE
development tools for hacking on Snowdrift.

## Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a modern, graphical, highly-extensible text-editor,
good for beginners and advanced alike. It is relatively new, and Haskell support
is continually improving.

### Atom settings

Some settings to consider:

* Tab Length: 4 (easy enough to enter 2 spaces for hamlet)
* Packages/Tree View: turn on "Hide Ignored Names" and "Hide VCS Ignored Files"
* Disable the "metrics" package to stop Atom sending data to Google Analytics

### Atom packages

We recommend adding at least the Atom packages:
[language-shakespeare](https://atom.io/packages/language-shakespeare) and
[language-haskell](https://atom.io/packages/language-haskell).

Other useful Atom packages to consider:

* Various Git-related tools:
    * [tree-view-git-status](https://atom.io/packages/tree-view-git-status)
    * [git-blame](https://atom.io/packages/git-blame)
    * [show-origin](https://atom.io/packages/show-origin)
    * searching will show many other git tools worth considering
* General nice tools like [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap),
  [cursor-history](https://atom.io/packages/cursor-history),
  [clipboard-history](https://atom.io/packages/clipboard-history),
  [multi-cursor](https://atom.io/packages/multi-cursor)
* [vim-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode) (if you like vim style editing)
    * consider the Clipboard as Default Register and Smartcase Search options
    * incidentally, many normal Atom editing operations still work as well
    * search packages for "vim-mode" to see extra related addons

### Tags to jump to function definitions in Atom

* run `stack install hasktags`
* in /snowdrift, run `hasktags -x -c --ignore-close-implementation ./*`
    * This must be re-run any time you want tags updated for newer code.
* Use Ctrl-Shift-R to jump to any tag or Ctrl-Alt-Down to jump to the
  definition of the symbol under the cursor using and Ctrl-Alt-Up to return
  (with vim-mode, Ctrl-] and Ctrl-t work as well).
    * This works for our internal functions only. For outside functions, search
      [Hayhoo](http://hayoo.fh-wedel.de/).

## Emacs

[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a traditional, robust,
keyboard-centric text editor with substantial Haskell support.

### Emacs settings

Our included `.dir-locals.el` file
[makes Emacs use](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
the recommended 4-space indentation.

### Emacs packages and variants

Emacs users should install
[Haskell Mode](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode) and
[Shakespeare Mode](https://github.com/CodyReichert/shakespeare-mode).

If you are new to Emacs,
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) is an enhanced
distribution of Emacs with better default configuration. It includes things like
[Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) and
[Projectile](http://batsov.com/projectile/) by default.

If you are coming from Vim, consider
[Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), an Emacs distribution that
includes Vim's modal keybindings by default along with much of Prelude's default
configuration. Aside from Spacemacs, you can get the Vim keybindings in any
Emacs distribution using [evil-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil).

Also of interest:

* [Magit](http://magit.vc/) is a high-quality Emacs git interface.
* [Structured Haskell Mode](https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode)
  (same author as Haskell Mode) takes a lot of tedium out of Haskell editing.
* [HIndent](https://github.com/chrisdone/hindent/) (same author again)
  will pretty-print your Haskell-code along the same lines as SHM.

## Leksah

[Leksah](http://leksah.org/) is a Haskell-dedicated complete IDE in the works,
but we're waiting for integration with Stack before we fully recommend it.

## Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is a robust traditional editor with a command-line
style interface and great Haskell support.

Note: we recommend all vim users install `vim-gtk` to enable access to system
clipboards, regardless of then using terminal-based vim or the gvim interface
with visual menus.

### Vim settings

We recommend that your ~/.vimrc file include:

    syntax on
    set number title hlsearch ignorecase smartcase showbreak=â†ª
    set textwidth=80 expandtab shiftwidth=4 tabstop=4
    au FileType hamlet setl sw=2 sts=2 et
    au Filetype gitcommit setl spell textwidth=72

Many other settings are nice, but opinions vary about the details.

### Vim plugins

We recommend using a Vim plugin manager such as
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
and the following plugins particularly relevant to snowdrift:

* [vim-syntax-shakespeare](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-syntax-shakespeare)
* [haskell-vim](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/haskell-vim)
* [vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown)
* [vim2hs](https://github.com/dag/vim2hs)
    * optional: add `set nofoldenable` to .vimrc to stop vim2hs function folding

The plugins listed above mostly do syntax highlighting and do not affect
commands or basic operations, so they are safe for everyone to use without
hesitation or learning process.

Other plugins we suggest for consideration include some which take zero or
near-zero learning to use:
[vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible),
[vim-repeat](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat),
[vim-supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab),
[vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter),
[vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround),
[vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary),
[ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim);
and others which take some learning and/or set up:
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive),
[undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree),
[NERD tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) &
[NERD tree git plugin](https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin),
[ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim),
[vim-easyclip](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree),
[vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline).

*Many* other options exist, although we'd rather contributors generally focus
more on building Snowdrift than maximizing their Vim expertise.

### Tags to jump to function definitions in Vim

* Run `stack install fast-tags`
* In the snowdrift directory, run this big command to prime your tags
  file:

        git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep -E '*.hs' | xargs fast-tags

    For edification, that command is a pipeline that prints all files in
    the repository, filters just the Haskelly ones, and passes them to
    fast-tags for processing.

    I (Bryan) have created an alias for that command in my ~/.bashrc so I can
    run it easily.

        alias git-fast-tags="git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep -E '*.hs' | xargs fast-tags"

    (Technically, there are other types of Haskelly files, such as \*.hsc
    and \*.lhs, but we don't have them in Snowdrift.)

* You may want to put that big command into .git/hooks/post-checkout
  so it reruns every time you check out a new branch. Don't forget to make
  the hook file executable:

        cat >> .git/hooks/post-checkout <<EOF
        git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep -E '*.hs' | xargs fast-tags
        EOF
        chmod u+x .git/hooks/post-checkout

* For auto-update in Vim, add an autocommand to the Haskell plugin file:

        mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
        cat >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/haskell.vim <<EOF
        augroup fasttag
            autocmd!
            autocmd BufWritePost <buffer> silent !fast-tags %
        augroup END
        EOF

    The critical line has "BufWritePost", and says to run fast-tags on
    the current file whenever it gets written.

* Then, in any Haskell file, use Ctrl-] to jump to the definition of the symbol
  under the cursor, and Ctrl-t to jump back.
    * This works for our internal functions only. For outside functions,
      [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/lts-2/hoogle) will have
      documentation on almost all of our dependencies.
